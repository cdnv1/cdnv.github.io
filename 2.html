  As mentioned earlier, CSS is a language that specifies how a document should be displayed to the user — styles, layout, etc.

A document is usually a text file organized using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but other markup languages ​​such as SVG or XML can also be used.

Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a format that your audience can use. Browsers , Firefox , Chrome , or Edge are designed to display documents visually, whether on a computer screen, a projector, or a printer.
